# Humble to Calibre

Little Python script that takes directories with book files and puts files for the same book (in different formats) into the same sub-directory. This makes it easy for books to be imported into Calibre with the option "Add from folders and sub-folders".

## Usage

```python
python humble_to_calibre.py -- [BOOK_DIRECTORIES...] 
```
